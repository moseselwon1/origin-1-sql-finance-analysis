# 🔍 Origin-1: SQL-Based Financial Analysis Project
## 🚀 Why I Built This

I'm a 19-year-old aspiring analyst from a non-target background. I wanted to prove I can think and operate like a real analyst — building financial logic, structuring data, and writing meaningful insights, all without needing access to private terminals or internships.
